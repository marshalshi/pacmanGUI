pacmanGUI
=========

a simple GUI about pacman in archlinux

just several pacman I have done. but others are same. so i did not do them.

this program is simple. maybe there are bugs in it. 
Because this program is just for fun, I don't have other time to debug. 
and when I have time, I will do a better one.

I use python 2.7 and wxpython 2.8.

how to use:
  type in your terminate:  python2 wxui.py
